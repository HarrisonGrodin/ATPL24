\section{Call-by-Push-Value (CBPV)}
Last week we introduced the lax framework of computation type.
This week, we introduce another approach to stratify value types and computation types,
called \emph{call-by-push-value} (CBPV), or \emph{polarization}.

Instead of introducing a type former for computation types,
we maintain the distinction between type structures instead.
We consider positive types \emph{values types}, which we denote as $A$,
and negative types \emph{computation types}, which we denote as $X$.
The polarity here is related to the polarity of the corresponding connectives in linear logic.
Similar to adjoint logic, we link these two families of types with an adjunction,
where the computation fragment is similar to the linear fragment in adjoint logic.

The syntax of types in CBPV is given by the following grammar:

\[
    \begin{array}{rcl}
        \text{Computation types} \quad & X ::= & \prodTy*{X_1}{X_2} \mid \parrTy*{A_1}{X_2} \mid F(A) \\
        \text{Value types} \quad       & A ::= & \topTy* \mid \tensorTy*{A_1}{A_2} \mid \sumTy*{A_1}{A_2} \mid U(X) \\
    \end{array}
\]

For simplicity, we introduce the function type only as a computation type,
and for products, we introduce both versions, corresponding to the nature of the product that
it can be used positively or negatively.

\subsection{Statics}

The static semantics of CBPV is defined by the following judgment given by the following typing rules:
